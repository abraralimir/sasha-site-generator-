                            A consumer packaged goods (CPG) company struggled with frequent stockouts of popular items and overstocking of others. Sasha was implemented to take over their demand and inventory planning. By analyzing point-of-sale data in real-time, Sasha created forecasts that were 40% more accurate than the company's previous methods. It then automated the entire procurement process, resulting in a 90% reduction in stockouts and a 25% reduction in excess inventory, adding millions to their bottom line.
