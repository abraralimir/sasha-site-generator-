                        <p className="text-neutral-300">
                           A financial services company wanted to move their legacy, on-premise trading application to Azure to improve scalability and reduce costs. A manual migration was quoted at 18 months. Sasha was deployed and autonomously mapped the entire environment, designed a new microservices-based architecture on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and automated the data migration from their on-premise SQL Server to Azure SQL. The entire migration was completed and validated in 5 months with zero downtime.
