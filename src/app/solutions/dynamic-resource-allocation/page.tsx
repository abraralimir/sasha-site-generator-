                           A major tech company was facing a ballooning AWS bill. After integrating Sasha, the agent immediately identified millions in potential savings. It autonomously analyzed usage patterns and began rightsizing over-provisioned servers, deleting unattached storage volumes, and purchasing Reserved Instances for steady-state workloads. Within three months, Sasha had reduced the company's cloud spend by 30% without any negative impact on performance.
